#underbar

Underscore.js is a popular collection of useful functions authored by Jeremy Ashkenas. In this project, I reimplement many of the utility functions.

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). It's a reimplementation of functions from the underbar.js library.
